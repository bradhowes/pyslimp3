#summary Details of the album rating view and editor

[http://pyslimp3.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/AlbumRating.jpg]

= Introduction =

The AlbumRatingDisplay class allows the user to view and edit the iTunes rating of a album. The UP and DOWN arrow keys change the rating. Also, the numbers 0 - 5 may be used to specify a rating; pressing the digit a second time will increase the rating by 1/2.

  <b>NOTE:</b> this is derived from the OverlayDisplay class, so it will automatically revert to the previous display after 3 seconds of inactivity by the user.

= Keys Supported =

|| UP || Increase the rating ||
|| DOWN || Decrease the rating ||
|| LEFT || Return to the parent level and display ||
|| 0-5 || Set the rating that corresponds to the digit ||
