# Introduction #

The DisplayGenerator class defines the interface for provides of SLiMP3 content. It also defines some fundamental key mappings that all derived classes obtain for free. At a minimum, a derived class must override the `generate()` method in order to return a [Content](Content.md) class that contains the lines to display on the SLiMP3 device.

The DisplayGenerator adds entries to the key map for the LEFT button and the digit buttons on the remote control. The LEFT button maps to the `left()` routine, which offers default functionality of returning to a higher browser level. Each digit has its own map entry that will invoke a routine with the name `digit#()` where '#' is a number from 0 - 9. The default implementation is to invoke the general `digit( value )` routine where `value` is the integer value corresponding to the button that was pressed. Derived classes may override either the `digit#()` routine(s) or the more general `digit()` one, or both.
