Pyslimp3: the Python SLiMP3-iTunes interface

Project home is at http://code.google.com/p/pyslimp3/

To run the server:

    % python Server.py

To run the basic simulator:

    % python sim.py

There is a graphical simulator now that requires Nokia's Qt library. It is
found in the qtsim directory. See qtsim/README for more information.
